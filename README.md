# ARMenu
Lua main menu for Garry's Mod (work in progress).

# Installing
Move the contents of ARMenu into the "garrysmod" folder.  
The "menu.lua" file should be at "garrysmod/lua/menu/menu.lua".  
The "armenu" folder should be at "garrysmod/lua/menu/armenu".  

# Toggling
ARMenu can be toggled on and off using the "armenu_toggle" console command.
This requires a file named "menu_default.lua" in "garrysmod/lua/menu", the same folder with "menu.lua" in it.
Renaming the default menu or any other menu you'd like to toggle will work.
